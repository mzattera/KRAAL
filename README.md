# KRAAL

KRAAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Awesome Algorithms and L? - OK, I made this up) is a set of Graql rules and ontologies aiming at transforming [Grakn](https://grakn.ai/) into a RDF triple store with integrated OWL reasoner.

In addition, some "glue" code to import RDF into Grakn is provided.
